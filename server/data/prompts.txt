Yesterday, I went to the weirdest party.
You won't guess what I found.
I only had a rope and a tennis ball.
I'm conducting a new experiment.
I've just finished writing a song.
Last week, I watched the best movie ever.
Life is full of surprises and I didn't realize it until last night!
My best friend is not here.
My eyes started watering when I got a whiff of that smell.
My neighbour does the same thing every night.
She kept talking and all I could do was nod my head.
Someone left a note under my door.
There's a new cooking magazine on the market.
There's one thing that I'm really good at.
There's something missing in my life.
This morning, I woke up late and noticed that I was not alone!
Today was a really good day and I had lots of fun!
Today, I was awakened by a loud CRASH!
Tomorrow, I will do my first pitch.
When I think too much, I have uncontrollable gas.
Yesterday, I bought something that I have been seeking for a long time.
Yesterday, I met the most awkward girl.
"That's not mine", I said to the police officer.
"This is my table", she said.
Everyone watched, as I stood naked in the middle of the room.
Everything around me seemed to go into slow motion.
He pretended to get something out of his eye in order to look at me.
I always do the same thing when I see a bald man.
I am not who you think I am.
I hate tall people with small hands!
I hate wearing underwear!
I have a new theory about life.
I have a voice constantly speaking in my head.
I head a book that has an amazing story.
I read an article abou8t a new invention that is going to change the world.
I received an email from someone that I don't know.
I stood at the edge, took a breath, and jumped.
I have secret and valuable information.
I just got the weirdest phone call.
I looked at my watch and I was already late.
I love the lyrics of a song that I heard yesterday.
I never believed in therapists, but I went to see one last week.
"I'm not married", he said.
I stood in front of a room full o fpeople waiting for my answer.
I was invited to write an article for a newspaper.
I was so hungry that I had to do it.
I will never forget that day.
I'll never eat bananas again.
I'm taking a new pill that works miracles.
I've got a new gadget. Best gadget ever!
